# Only War: The New Chapter
I was looking for something to do with my pandemic-related free time, and none of my other repos were calling to me. It was then that conversation in the Chapter Master thread over on the Bay12 forum reared its head again. And, I figured, sure, why not take a look?
So I started fiddling in Unity again, reminding myself of what I'd learned in my forrays previously. Originally, I was just going to try and take the GameMaker code as-is and do a faithful conversion. I quickly realized that was going to be more painful than I wanted. Plus, Duke had made some design decisions along the way I didn't like. Well, let's start basic, then, and get the sector map working... then the chapter map... guess that means I need soldier generation...

I was probably two weeks in when I realized I was actually committing code on a nightly basis, and feeling good about my progress. I made a trello board. At that point, I figured I was commited, at least to getting something I could put in front of people and have do a thing.

No promises on how long that drive lasts, but I'm over a month in, have averaged about 1 commit a day, and have something I'm willing to call a pre-alpha tech demo. So, so far, so good.
